# RainCatcher BaseModule

This is a template for modules in the RainCatcher project, it contains the default dotfiles and other configuration files for the development tooling and the directory structure expected from individual modules.

RainCatcher code is written in [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org), uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for unit tests and [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) for test coverage checks.

For an explanation of the expected internals of each package, see the [main README](../../README.md#package-structure)

## Using this template

When creating a new module, copy the entire contents of this folder and make the following adjustments to [`package.json` ](./package.json):

  - `name`: Update to new package's name
  - `version`: Set it to your new intended semver (i.e. `0.0.0` or `1.0.0`)
  - `description`: Remove the existing description and replace it with your own
  - `author`: Update to reflect possible new author
  - `dependencies`: Remove the sample dependency on `@raincatcher/example-base`

Until the module compiles correctly via TypeScript, you might need to run `npm install --ignore-scripts`, to avoid triggering the defined `prepublish` script that runs the compilation. If the compilation step fails, npm might not install all dependencies. This behavior is supposed to change on `npm>=5`.

### Removing unit tests

In order to remove all of the existing unit test sample setup, make the following alterations:

- Remove the contents of the `test/` folder.
- Remove the test-related `devDependencies`: mocha, source-map-support and nyc
- Remove the test, debug and debug-legacy scripts.
- Remove the `"nyc"` extra configuration key from `package.json`


### Supported scripts

`npm run clean` - removes all compiled sources

`npm run build` - build typescript code

`npm run start` - run module (valid only for top level modules)

`npm run test` - execute unit tests
